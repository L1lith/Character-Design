  <h2 class="c11 c22" id="h.q2ckyq97y625"><span class="c7 c5">Personality</span></h2>
  <p class="c21"><span class="c1">Generally very relaxed and friendly though she can be a bit of a loner. She can become angry or on occasion violent when she or someone else is treated unjustly, so she&rsquo;s a bit of a vigilante/rebel.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
  <h2 class="c16" id="h.691krfuma3z9"><span class="c7 c5"></span></h2>
  <h2 class="c24" id="h.iucq5f6zvpf1"><span class="c1 c9">Jade</span></h2>
  <p class="c17"><span class="c1">(Companion)</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c18">This small winged lizard (not a dragon, much smaller and no fire, sits on shoulder generally) loves to bond with Lilith through their adventures. Jade provides Lilith with vital scouting with it&rsquo;s flight
      ability and fast speed. It also provides her with emotional support.</span></p>
  <p class="c21"><span class="c5 c13">Abilities</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_ho9s3sdetw6n-0 start">
    <li class="c19"><span class="c3">Venomous bite</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c0">Induces pain &amp; paralysis for a few hours or so depending on the target species, but is generally non-lethal except on small creatures. This move can be risky as it requires getting up close to the target, but
      payoff is good, and the risk can be mitigated by using sneak attacks.</span></p>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_rhe48we21j2d-0 start">
    <li class="c12"><span class="c3">Flight</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c0">Jade flies very quickly and agilely through the sky. This is very useful for scouting purposes or landing it&rsquo;s other abilities like venomous bite on ranged targets.</span></p>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_ruoammf9pqdl-0 start">
    <li class="c20 c23"><span class="c3">Claws &amp; Tail</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Jade has long, sharp claws, and a long whip-like tail. Both are decent options for aerial attacks, however Jade&rsquo;s attack power is lower than most creatures given it&rsquo;s small size, so it&rsquo;s ability to
      deal damage can be limited. Jade&rsquo;s battle strategy usually is to go </span><span class="c1">for venomous</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bite instead, however if she needs to she can swoop in for a quick swipe, and hope to dash back out
      before the opponent gets a strike back. Also as a reptile, scratches from her can also lead to nasty infections in many species if the wound is not cleaned properly, which can eventually result in amputations or sometimes even death if left to
      fester.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
  <h2 class="c16" id="h.310dgdm6083g"><span class="c7 c5"></span></h2>
  <h2 class="c11" id="h.fr6642yop4hg"><span class="c7 c5">Items of Note</span></h2>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_6cjitlt9fs61-0 start">
    <li class="c12"><span class="c1">Item: </span><span class="c5">Destiny </span><span class="c3">Apple</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c0">The Destiny Apple is a magical apple she can consume, and it nourishes her based on how much she is at peace with herself. Eating it never consumes the item, however she can still starve if she betrays her sense of
      self. It is the only thing that can nourish her long-term, however she can eat other foods to subdue herself.</span></p>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_hqx8paee5ye5-0 start">
    <li class="c12"><span class="c1">Weapon: </span><span class="c3">Metal Nails &amp; Hair</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c10"><span class="c0">Not unlike how human&rsquo;s skin cells die and form into nail &amp; hair after they&rsquo;ve fulfilled their purpose, so does Lilith&rsquo;s iron skin ability. At the end of her fingers she has large pointed claws
      made of iron, which she grinds against rough rocks to sharpen and file. Her hair is also coated in iron, allowing her to use it as a whip if grown sufficiently long (she usually does this, and keeps it hidden inside her hood).</span></p>
  <p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p>
  <p class="c4 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
  <h2 class="c16" id="h.ls7pb6sj0j4t"><span class="c7 c5"></span></h2>
  <h2 class="c11" id="h.kvz6xif18e1k"><span class="c7 c5">Abilities</span></h2>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_vdec2ozezoo7-0 start">
    <li class="c4 c20"><span class="c5">Coded</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Very analytically intelligent,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">ability to decipher and recreate any kind of pattern or language. This includes the ability to communicate with animals, and speak in
      other languages once she&rsquo;s heard them, or perform skilled predictions and analysis.</span></p>
  <ul class="c8 lst-kix_g6nephsj5adi-0 start">
    <li class="c4 c20"><span class="c3">Iron Skin</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c0">The outer layer of Lilith&rsquo;s skin is made of iron. It is sort of like a biological light armor, or thin iron exoskeleton. It is thin enough not to hinder her movements, however it is still considerably heavy, so
      she has a lot of muscle to compensate, making her a massive 325lbs. </span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c0">This weight means that she consumes a fairly large amount of energy, leading her on moral conquests to feed her hunger using her Destiny Apple (this would be actions that cause right in the world, however she sees
      it). </span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c0">This skill also lends very heavily to hand to hand combat. With her large body she has high traveling speed, however in a fight her iron skin makes her agility very average so quick opponents can use this to their
      advantage, however she compensates for this somewhat with her long limbs and armor properties, using her superior reach to keep her opponent from landing vital blows, and dulling the ones that do land, basically a tank. Ranged or flying
      opponents pose the greatest threat, however her flying companion Jade can compensate for this to some degree. </span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c1">She also can be quick to overheat during sustained activity or in hot environments, especially if she is not adequately hydrated. When she </span><span class="c1">overheats</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her iron skin
      layer gradually peels off, eventually leaving her body effectively that of a regular (albeit large, bald, and with no fingernails) human if left untreated (this also is not permanent, she can slowly regenerate if she cools down and consumes
      more iron). Biologically speaking, except for changes related to her skills she is quite similar to a tall human.</span></p>
  <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
  <p class="c4 c6"><span class="c5 c7"></span></p>
  <h2 class="c11" id="h.wjqt91waz619"><span class="c5 c15">Backstory</span></h2>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c0">Lilith was created by an experiment by a cult of religiously driven mad scientists. For this reason she deeply hates corrupt social hierarchies. In a painfully stereotypical fashion, she murdered the cult that had
      created her. She left her empty village and began wandering around aimlessly until she found Simul. </span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c0">She is comparable to a sort of biological machine hybrid. She&rsquo;s not a computer, however she shares similar character attributes (she incorporates large quantities of iron into her body, and she is highly
      intelligent/analytical, but she has more difficulty breaking into her creative mind, though ironically she can be quick to express her more primal emotions). She also has memory issues so she can often be forgetful.</span></p>
  <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Her will and hunger are physically linked through her Destiny Apple, and it drives her to seek justice in the world. She&rsquo;s sort of an outsider because of her iron skin and large size, and she has a strong bond
      with her lizard. She also can get a lot of hate from people who see her actions as drastic, or claim that she has no right to interfere as an outsider. She travels from city to city, trying to find happiness for herself and others. She is
      challenged by homelessness, and forgetting her purpose, sometimes leading her to act out of hunger for better or worse. </span></p>
