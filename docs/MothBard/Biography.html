  </h1>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Born in the uncharted depths of Pluvia -</span><span class="c3 c4">or as those of Simul know it, the Southern Forest- </span><span class="c2">during the great Bloom, Maple&rsquo;s was baptised by the very leaf of
      which their larvae feasted upon so long ago, it was a simple life that of a Laetuli, no crown ruled over them, no man to dictate their strata, for -much like despicable pirates- they took to the practice of conducting themselves via consensus,
      each and every cargo taken up for those proven worthy of such crown in the face of the consulate, Bloom always had a wish to work in the arts, inspired by the Ballards of the previous community bard, they sought to learn from the best, so one
      day they too may lighten the day of their fellow, taking to listening to performances of outsider bards in the nearby settlements Bloom started to slowly understand how a bard should act, of course, nowhere near the skill and prowess of a true
      Laetuli artist, but the Mon-keigh would suffice for now.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Following the death of the chief of culture of their community Maple&rsquo;s entered their bid, showcasing a most unique ballard indeed, inspired by the &ldquo;primal&rdquo; culture of the Mon-keigh in combination
      with Laetuli harmonious tunes they created what is now a masterpiece within Laetuli circles, the results were swift, and so was elected the best bard in Pluvia. In their success Bloom began to further study Simulian culture, all they sought was
      to improve their abilities, but what began as mere hobby in hopes of betterment slowly developed into a deep appreciation and fascination, Laetuli society never had much of an interest in contacting the outside as they feared that if others
      knew of them, they would be conquered and purged, much like the wildlife around them, taking their chances Bloom consulted with the Consulate, &ldquo;Shall i be granted the privilege of leaving on pilgrimage? To learn of the Mon-Keigh?&rdquo;
      the consuls believed them to have gone mad, what were they thinking? To approach the Mon-Keight would certainly mean death! But the bard insisted, what had he to lose but their chains? After incessant debate and bickering the go ahead was
      given, and so departed Bloom in their quest to learn and improve the arts.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In their innocent search for artistic inspiration Maple&rsquo;s Bloom came under the service of a local baron, marginalized by their non-humanoid and peculiar guttural accent, the baron was able to do as he pleased
      with the Laetuli, forcing them under indentured servitude for the following years, every day the same routine, a court jester, knives were thrown in their despicable games, deprived of food and sleep Bloom had just about had it, their resolve
      tested the young bard put a finale to this stage play, one fateful night their mandibles dug deep into the barons flesh, ripping off his finger as a prize Maple&rsquo;s left the the keep in secrecy stealing what they could off of the courtiers,
      to evade capture they left Pluvia for good.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not entirely broken by this experience Bloom continued their quest of self improvement and learning, but now with the stereotypes they knew validated by the baron and the court they now wander cautious of the
      Mon-Keigh around them, of course, not all of the Mon-Keigh were like this, right? Right?</span></p>
