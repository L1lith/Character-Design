  </h1>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c10">~Tools and Curios~</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c32 c12 c13"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">The Hurdy Gurdy;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3 c4">&ldquo;An unusual stringed instrument capable of emitting a melody unique to itself, being a whole band&rsquo;s worth in a single piece.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Although not inherently magical the tunes it can play bring out the best in people, boosting morale and motivating those that hear it to pursue their goals, a true testament to the power of the arts.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Fine Lute;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3 c4">&ldquo;For times of action and excitement, the Lute is dedicated to the call to arms and raised banners of the battlefield.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A Lute made of fine wood, one can only assume to be the work of a master in their craft, it&rsquo;s tunes are capable of getting out the adrenaline of those who hear it, the excitement of the strings translating well
      to the body of a soldier midst a fight.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c17 c12 c13"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Sack of sacks;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3 c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a purse really, may look small, but trust me, you can fit so many more sacks in there&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A small sack, capable of fitting on the palm of one&rsquo;s hands, reportedly stolen from &ldquo;A man with a very pointy hat&rdquo; the space within it is greatly larger than one would expect, having enough space to
      roughly fit one to two average adult human males within it, currently it seems to be mostly filled with a variety of flamboyant headgear and many, many, many broken musical instruments.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Tyrant&rsquo;s FigerBone;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3 c4">&ldquo;Heh. The last laugh was mine after all.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A fingerbone of unknown origin, a ring can be found in it, seemingly made of gold with a sapphire like gemstone adorned upon it, according to the owner it&rsquo;s a rather comedic sight, but to most it is just
      macabre.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c8">~Weaponry~</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c8"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Ornate Dirk</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pointy, is it not?&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A well decorated dirk dagger meant for thrusting, forged in wootz steel it stands at 20 centimeters (7.8 inches), the blade itself is edgeless but it&rsquo;s point is extremely well sharpened.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Iron Sickel</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fits extremely well in a Mon-Keigh&rsquo;s throat&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A simple farmer&rsquo;s tool now utilized for cutting more than just rye, it&rsquo;s iron blade stretches to 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) and suffers from partial rusting, however it&rsquo;s curvature is well defined
      and edge sharpened being able to cut through tall grass with ease.</span></p>
