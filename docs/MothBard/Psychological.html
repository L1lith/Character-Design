    <span class="c14">Psychological Profile</span>
  </h1>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A connoisseur of the arts Maple&rsquo;s Bloom believes that artistic production is the greatest manner to reflect one&rsquo;s soul, be them visual or auditory, they reflect the artists deepest desires and opinions,
      any and all disrespect to the arts is a disrespect to Bloom themselves. For what would be life worth living if not for the Avante Garde.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bloom is extremely soft hearted -both physically and mentally- resulting in them being friendly and trusting, even to those that are newly met, for seemingly no particular reason, this openness -however- comes at the
      cost that strikes that force their resolve to be tested have a tendency to lead to downward spirals of irrationality, hopelessness, paranoia and general sadness.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Due to not only their upbringing in a the Laetuli free territories and experience with nobility they have come to generally disrespect the authority of the crown, believing the nobility to be; &ldquo;A bunch of
      absolute snobs that want to make fun of everyone bellow them&rdquo; following this, Bloom has come to adopt a philosophy of &ldquo;do as you please as long as it hurts no one&rdquo; which they uphold zealously, becoming quite disliked by those
      in high places within the Simulian administration of the Southern Forests for their constant disobedience of Simulian law and bureaucrats.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Although welcoming to humanoids -regardless of their less than stellar first impressions- Bloom is, in all truth, rather suspicious of them, however desperately desires to be proven wrong in regards to their suspicion
      and stereotypes taught to them in their time within Laetuli society and later proven in the baron&rsquo;s court.</span></p>
