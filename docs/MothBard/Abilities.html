  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3 c4">&ldquo;Combat is a power ballad - a slow build up, and a grand finale!&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4 c12"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c14 c21 c13">~Biological Defences~</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c17 c12 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Bug bite</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Originally developed to bite the bark off of trees the mandibles of the Laetuli are extremely strong, being able to lacerate the flesh of most animals, crack their scales and -when under favourable conditions- even
      partially dig in to bone, Laetuli rarely use their bite against opponents as it requires that they come close to their target, a move that can expose their fragile body to a most likely fatal attack.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3 c4">Corrosive spit</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">(2 turn cooldown)</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A biochemical defense mechanism developed to fend off predators, by a combination of chemical compounds present in their abdomen, the Laetuli can create a high velocity corrosive substance that is expelled from their
      mouths (of which can travel 3 meters or 9 feet at 3 feet a second or 1 meter per second), this substance mostly causes a first degree chemical burns and irritation of the affected area, however, when spit continuously in the same general area
      effects may worsen, leading to potential fourth degree burns and even the melting of wood &amp; under the right circumstances certain metals.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Natural Charisma</span><span class="c17 c12 c13">&nbsp;(OOC permissions required)</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c17 c12 c13"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Amongst hunters and explorers of the deep southern forests rumours run rampant of encounters with Laetuli, one idea is always prevalent and ever common in these tales, the apparent &ldquo;cuteness&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;charisma&rdquo; of this species, generally speaking these arthropods tend to make those around them feel more comfortable and jolly with their presence, the Laetuli have come to embrace this with most of those (very few) that leave their
      homes taking up jobs as entertainers, psychologists and professional </span><span class="c3 c29">pillows</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">huggers</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in Simul.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not exactly a skill nor an ability but more precisely a consequence of the chemical compounds in their abdomen, after dying the careful balance that allows these to exist deteriorates, leading to the abdomen of the
      Laetuli in question to explode soon after death, causing the chemicals within to be shot in multiple directions (clearing an area of 2 meters, or 6,5 feet in the explosion in a second)</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Limited flight</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Laetuli are capable of a limited form of flight, being that the species is capable of maintaining a maximum height of 3 meters (9 feet) above ground and a speed of 54km/h (33.7 miles/h) for an extended period (3-4
      hours of flight out of combat, just 5 turns during combat) when buzzing their wings, normally -however- Laetuli prefer to stay at the same height as the head of whoever they may be speaking to.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c14 c21 c13"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c17">( Obs; those affected by these sound based abilities are those targeted by the song in question, unless the song has no subject, if that is the case then the effects are felt by all sapien creatures in a 3,5 meters
      radius (11 feet) to a lesser extent. All the song&#39;s effects last 5 turns each and if used more than once in a battle the duration is reset, the same song cannot be played twice in a roll and their effects are dependent on the
      listener&rsquo;s interpretation of the lyrics and melody, all of them having two explicit effects, one positive and the other negative being that the first explained effect is the intended effects of the song and the second one being the
      potential drawback. Suffice it to say </span><span class="c23 c28">all of these require OOC permission</span><span class="c12 c13 c17">&nbsp;as they affect the mind of the targeted listeners)</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Battle ballad</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Requires a Lute or Violin to perform, effects amplified when utilizing Lute) </span><span class="c3 c4">Lose not your grip on the dreams of the past, you must fight just to keep them alive!</span><span
      class="c2">&nbsp;An energetic epic dedicated to a great warrior, the ballad is a delicate balance between energetic ups and suspenseful downs, one&rsquo;s interpretation of these waves of emotion may very well be the difference between victory
      and defeat. Of course, one may take these tales as a triumphant show of will, boosting their confidence and giving them the morale boost needed for a decisive strike, however&hellip; One could also see these as just that, tales, nothing more,
      nothing less, a nice composure of course, but certainly nothing more than a mere nuisance midst combat.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c4 c15">Memento Mori</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Requires a Lute or Hurdy Gurdy, both being equally effective) </span><span class="c3 c4">I care not. And so I am immortal</span><span class="c2">, a calm and collected song, telling of the beauty of life and serenity
      of death, a statement to the marvel of the never ending cycle of birth and slaughter. To the ears of the sussetable many reactions may come of this acceptance of destiny and the cycle of life, some will come to understand and embrace this
      cycle, fearless of what may wait for them behind the curtains they would feel reinvigorated, their wounds almost painless now that the material world loses its significance in the face of their eternal soul. Not all will embrace lady death and
      the inevitabilities of life however, they will take this as a grim reminder of the consequences of their actions, becoming fearful of the possible outcomes of a battle, shaking and losing sight of themselves, questioning why they&rsquo;d even
      be here, risking the only life they have.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Every Rose has it&rsquo;s Thorns</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c15 c4 c18"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Requires a Lute or Hurdy Gurdy, being that the Hurdy Gurdy is most effective) </span><span class="c3 c4">Every night has its dawn</span><span class="c2">, this song is dedicated to reminding the listener that there
      is yet hope even when times are desperate and that nothing will ever conquer their will. Those that heed to a bard&rsquo;s advice feel as if a burden is lifted, their hopes in the future restored adrenalynn once more rushes through their body
      healing their wounds and restoring their energies. But who&rsquo;d listen to a court jester for advice? And if you were to really think about it even a thorn could kill if well placed! And just as the thoughts and doubt start to set into the
      mind the pain in the cuts worsens, stinging like a thousand bees as the listener finds themselves purposely holding to the thorns.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Maddening Mockery</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Requires a Violin or Lute to perform, being more effective when utilizing a Violin)(cannot be played in the user&rsquo;s first turn) </span><span class="c3 c4">Look at this fool, this imbecile! Playing the hero, are
      you?! </span><span class="c3">A whole dramatic poem dedicated mocking one&rsquo;s insecurities, being it their virility or combat prowess those that hear it tend to lose faith in their own ability, wavering and overthinking their plans in hopes
      of proving the bard wrong, now under a self imposed pressure they find it difficult to hit strikes consistently. But of course not all have such a fragile ego, </span><span class="c3 c4">or mayhaps their ego is even more fragile</span><span
      class="c2">, as some find themselves not filled with self doubt, but with anger and rage, with a new goal in mind; to put this clown in their rightful place, their fists heavier and more motivated than ever to meet with the bard&rsquo;s soft
      face.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Finale!</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Any instrument may be used for the finale as long as it was used during one of the previous performances) </span><span class="c3 c4">Maybe just cut all their throats... To be sure.</span><span
      class="c28 c22 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">A step forward, a swift strike, a pain akin to that of a spear through the heart comes down the spine, every presentation has an ending and this Finale shall be grand! Finale can only be used
      after performing one -or more- other songs, it&rsquo;s effectiveness is determined on how many songs were performed prior to it, when utilized the singer gives one last solo as they lunge at their target, decisively impaling them with a dirk,
      and as the curtains of life close the artist retreats back stage (their position prior to lunging) a job most exquisite indeed! The affected party is left in a rather deplorable state, their puncture wound bleeding the sudden nature of this
      attack leaves the target dazed (if OOC permissions are granted stunfor 1 turn) as they attempt to process how a large butterfly just stabbed them.</span></p>
