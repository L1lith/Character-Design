  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A connoisseur of the arts Maple&rsquo;s Bloom believes that artistic production is the greatest manner to reflect one&rsquo;s soul, be them visual or auditory, they reflect the artists deepest desires and opinions,
      any and all disrespect to the arts is a disrespect to Bloom themselves. For what would be life worth living if not for the Avante Garde.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bloom is extremely soft hearted -both physically and mentally- resulting in them being friendly and trusting, even to those that are newly met, for seemingly no particular reason, this openness -however- comes at the
      cost that strikes that force their resolve to be tested have a tendency to lead to downward spirals of irrationality, hopelessness, paranoia and general sadness.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Due to not only their upbringing in a the Laetuli free territories and experience with nobility they have come to generally disrespect the authority of the crown, believing the nobility to be; &ldquo;A bunch of
      absolute snobs that want to make fun of everyone bellow them&rdquo; following this, Bloom has come to adopt a philosophy of &ldquo;do as you please as long as it hurts no one&rdquo; which they uphold zealously, becoming quite disliked by those
      in high places within the Simulian administration of the Southern Forests for their constant disobedience of Simulian law and bureaucrats.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Although welcoming to humanoids -regardless of their less than stellar first impressions- Bloom is, in all truth, rather suspicious of them, however desperately desires to be proven wrong in regards to their suspicion
      and stereotypes taught to them in their time within Laetuli society and later proven in the baron&rsquo;s court.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c3 c4">&ldquo;An unusual stringed instrument capable of emitting a melody unique to itself, being a whole band&rsquo;s worth in a single piece.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Although not inherently magical the tunes it can play bring out the best in people, boosting morale and motivating those that hear it to pursue their goals, a true testament to the power of the arts.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c18 c4">Fine Lute;</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A Lute made of fine wood, one can only assume to be the work of a master in their craft, it&rsquo;s tunes are capable of getting out the adrenaline of those who hear it, the excitement of the strings translating well
      to the body of a soldier midst a fight.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A small sack, capable of fitting on the palm of one&rsquo;s hands, reportedly stolen from &ldquo;A man with a very pointy hat&rdquo; the space within it is greatly larger than one would expect, having enough space to
      roughly fit one to two average adult human males within it, currently it seems to be mostly filled with a variety of flamboyant headgear and many, many, many broken musical instruments.</span></p>

  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A fingerbone of unknown origin, a ring can be found in it, seemingly made of gold with a sapphire like gemstone adorned upon it, according to the owner it&rsquo;s a rather comedic sight, but to most it is just

  <p class="c1"><span class="c12 c14 c21 c13">~Biological Defences~</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c17 c12 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Bug bite</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Originally developed to bite the bark off of trees the mandibles of the Laetuli are extremely strong, being able to lacerate the flesh of most animals, crack their scales and -when under favourable conditions- even
      partially dig in to bone, Laetuli rarely use their bite against opponents as it requires that they come close to their target, a move that can expose their fragile body to a most likely fatal attack.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c11 c3 c4">Corrosive spit</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">(2 turn cooldown)</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A biochemical defense mechanism developed to fend off predators, by a combination of chemical compounds present in their abdomen, the Laetuli can create a high velocity corrosive substance that is expelled from their
      mouths (of which can travel 3 meters or 9 feet at 3 feet a second or 1 meter per second), this substance mostly causes a first degree chemical burns and irritation of the affected area, however, when spit continuously in the same general area
      effects may worsen, leading to potential fourth degree burns and even the melting of wood &amp; under the right circumstances certain metals.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Natural Charisma</span><span class="c17 c12 c13">&nbsp;(OOC permissions required)</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c17 c12 c13"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Amongst hunters and explorers of the deep southern forests rumours run rampant of encounters with Laetuli, one idea is always prevalent and ever common in these tales, the apparent &ldquo;cuteness&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;charisma&rdquo; of this species, generally speaking these arthropods tend to make those around them feel more comfortable and jolly with their presence, the Laetuli have come to embrace this with most of those (very few) that leave their
      homes taking up jobs as entertainers, psychologists and professional </span><span class="c3 c29">pillows</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c4">huggers</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in Simul.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4 c11">Post-Mortem Volatility</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c12 c3 c4"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not exactly a skill nor an ability but more precisely a consequence of the chemical compounds in their abdomen, after dying the careful balance that allows these to exist deteriorates, leading to the abdomen of the
      Laetuli in question to explode soon after death, causing the chemicals within to be shot in multiple directions (clearing an area of 2 meters, or 6,5 feet in the explosion in a second)</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c15 c4">Limited flight</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Laetuli are capable of a limited form of flight, being that the species is capable of maintaining a maximum height of 3 meters (9 feet) above ground and a speed of 54km/h (33.7 miles/h) for an extended period (3-4
      hours of flight out of combat, just 5 turns during combat) when buzzing their wings, normally -however- Laetuli prefer to stay at the same height as the head of whoever they may be speaking to.</span></p>

      radius (11 feet) to a lesser extent. All the song&#39;s effects last 5 turns each and if used more than once in a battle the duration is reset, the same song cannot be played twice in a roll and their effects are dependent on the
      listener&rsquo;s interpretation of the lyrics and melody, all of them having two explicit effects, one positive and the other negative being that the first explained effect is the intended effects of the song and the second one being the

      class="c2">&nbsp;An energetic epic dedicated to a great warrior, the ballad is a delicate balance between energetic ups and suspenseful downs, one&rsquo;s interpretation of these waves of emotion may very well be the difference between victory
      and defeat. Of course, one may take these tales as a triumphant show of will, boosting their confidence and giving them the morale boost needed for a decisive strike, however&hellip; One could also see these as just that, tales, nothing more,
      nothing less, a nice composure of course, but certainly nothing more than a mere nuisance midst combat.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Requires a Lute or Hurdy Gurdy, both being equally effective) </span><span class="c3 c4">I care not. And so I am immortal</span><span class="c2">, a calm and collected song, telling of the beauty of life and serenity
      of death, a statement to the marvel of the never ending cycle of birth and slaughter. To the ears of the sussetable many reactions may come of this acceptance of destiny and the cycle of life, some will come to understand and embrace this
      cycle, fearless of what may wait for them behind the curtains they would feel reinvigorated, their wounds almost painless now that the material world loses its significance in the face of their eternal soul. Not all will embrace lady death and
      the inevitabilities of life however, they will take this as a grim reminder of the consequences of their actions, becoming fearful of the possible outcomes of a battle, shaking and losing sight of themselves, questioning why they&rsquo;d even
      be here, risking the only life they have.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(Requires a Lute or Hurdy Gurdy, being that the Hurdy Gurdy is most effective) </span><span class="c3 c4">Every night has its dawn</span><span class="c2">, this song is dedicated to reminding the listener that there
      is yet hope even when times are desperate and that nothing will ever conquer their will. Those that heed to a bard&rsquo;s advice feel as if a burden is lifted, their hopes in the future restored adrenalynn once more rushes through their body
      healing their wounds and restoring their energies. But who&rsquo;d listen to a court jester for advice? And if you were to really think about it even a thorn could kill if well placed! And just as the thoughts and doubt start to set into the
      mind the pain in the cuts worsens, stinging like a thousand bees as the listener finds themselves purposely holding to the thorns.</span></p>

      after performing one -or more- other songs, it&rsquo;s effectiveness is determined on how many songs were performed prior to it, when utilized the singer gives one last solo as they lunge at their target, decisively impaling them with a dirk,
      and as the curtains of life close the artist retreats back stage (their position prior to lunging) a job most exquisite indeed! The affected party is left in a rather deplorable state, their puncture wound bleeding the sudden nature of this
      attack leaves the target dazed (if OOC permissions are granted stunfor 1 turn) as they attempt to process how a large butterfly just stabbed them.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Born in the uncharted depths of Pluvia -</span><span class="c3 c4">or as those of Simul know it, the Southern Forest- </span><span class="c2">during the great Bloom, Maple&rsquo;s was baptised by the very leaf of
      which their larvae feasted upon so long ago, it was a simple life that of a Laetuli, no crown ruled over them, no man to dictate their strata, for -much like despicable pirates- they took to the practice of conducting themselves via consensus,
      each and every cargo taken up for those proven worthy of such crown in the face of the consulate, Bloom always had a wish to work in the arts, inspired by the Ballards of the previous community bard, they sought to learn from the best, so one
      day they too may lighten the day of their fellow, taking to listening to performances of outsider bards in the nearby settlements Bloom started to slowly understand how a bard should act, of course, nowhere near the skill and prowess of a true
      Laetuli artist, but the Mon-keigh would suffice for now.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Following the death of the chief of culture of their community Maple&rsquo;s entered their bid, showcasing a most unique ballard indeed, inspired by the &ldquo;primal&rdquo; culture of the Mon-keigh in combination
      with Laetuli harmonious tunes they created what is now a masterpiece within Laetuli circles, the results were swift, and so was elected the best bard in Pluvia. In their success Bloom began to further study Simulian culture, all they sought was
      to improve their abilities, but what began as mere hobby in hopes of betterment slowly developed into a deep appreciation and fascination, Laetuli society never had much of an interest in contacting the outside as they feared that if others
      knew of them, they would be conquered and purged, much like the wildlife around them, taking their chances Bloom consulted with the Consulate, &ldquo;Shall i be granted the privilege of leaving on pilgrimage? To learn of the Mon-Keigh?&rdquo;
      the consuls believed them to have gone mad, what were they thinking? To approach the Mon-Keight would certainly mean death! But the bard insisted, what had he to lose but their chains? After incessant debate and bickering the go ahead was
      given, and so departed Bloom in their quest to learn and improve the arts.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In their innocent search for artistic inspiration Maple&rsquo;s Bloom came under the service of a local baron, marginalized by their non-humanoid and peculiar guttural accent, the baron was able to do as he pleased
      with the Laetuli, forcing them under indentured servitude for the following years, every day the same routine, a court jester, knives were thrown in their despicable games, deprived of food and sleep Bloom had just about had it, their resolve
      tested the young bard put a finale to this stage play, one fateful night their mandibles dug deep into the barons flesh, ripping off his finger as a prize Maple&rsquo;s left the the keep in secrecy stealing what they could off of the courtiers,
      to evade capture they left Pluvia for good.</span></p>
  <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not entirely broken by this experience Bloom continued their quest of self improvement and learning, but now with the stereotypes they knew validated by the baron and the court they now wander cautious of the
      Mon-Keigh around them, of course, not all of the Mon-Keigh were like this, right? Right?</span></p>
