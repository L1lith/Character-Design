  <h2 class="c27" id="abilities"><span class="c8 c23">Abilities</span></h2>
  <ul class="c12 lst-kix_vdec2ozezoo7-0 start">
    <li class="c28"><span class="c2 c7">Coded</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="c0">Very analytically intelligent,</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">ability to decipher and recreate any kind of pattern or language. This includes the ability to communicate with animals, and speak
      in other languages once she&rsquo;s heard them, or perform skilled predictions and analysis.</span></p>
  <ul class="c12 lst-kix_g6nephsj5adi-0 start">
    <li class="c28"><span class="c2 c7">Iron Skin</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="c0">The outer layer of Lilith&rsquo;s skin is made of iron. It is sort of like a biological light armor, or thin iron exoskeleton. It is thin enough not to hinder her movements, however it is still considerably heavy, so
      she has a lot of muscle to compensate, making her a massive 325lbs. </span></p>
  <p class="c5"><span class="c0">This weight means that she consumes a fairly large amount of energy, leading her on moral conquests to feed her hunger using her Destiny Apple (this would be actions that cause right in the world, however she sees
      it). </span></p>
  <p class="c5"><span class="c0">This skill also lends very heavily to hand to hand combat. With her large body she has high traveling speed, however in a fight her iron skin makes her agility very average so quick opponents can use this to their
      advantage, however she compensates for this somewhat with her long limbs and armor properties, using her superior reach to keep her opponent from landing vital blows, and dulling the ones that do land, basically a tank. Ranged or flying
      opponents pose the greatest threat, however her flying companion Jade can compensate for this to some degree. </span></p>
  <ul class="c12 lst-kix_g6nephsj5adi-0 start">
    <li class="c28"><span class="c2 c7">Survival Expert</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c0">Additionally Lilith is experienced in wilderness survival, so she can obtain food while traveling that way. This however can lead to her becoming nutritionally deficient, as wandering the wilderness for too long
      would cause the Destiny Apple to cease providing essential nutrients. She harvests valuable resources in nature (herbs, rare animal parts, rare rocks, etc) and sells them when she visits cities in order to make money.</span></p>
