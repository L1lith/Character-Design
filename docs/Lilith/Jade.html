  <p class="c7"><span class="c0">(Companion)</span></p>
  <p class="c12 c22"><span class="c0 c8 c1">This small winged lizard (not a dragon, much smaller and no fire,
sits on shoulder generally) loves to bond with Lilith through their adventures. Jade provides Lilith with vital
scouting with his flight ability and fast speed. He also provides her with emotional support.</span></p>

  <ul class="c25 lst-kix_ho9s3sdetw6n-0 start">
    <li class="c16"><span class="c0 c8 c1">Venomous bite</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c6 c12"><span class="c2 c0 c1">Induces pain &amp; paralysis for up to a few hours or so depending on the target species, but is generally non-lethal. This move can be risky as it requires getting up close to the target, but payoff is
      good, and the risk can be mitigated by using sneak attacks. Targets 20 lbs or less are at serious risk of death. Can only be used roughly once a day as it takes time for the poison to be restored. The poison duration chart starts counting from
      the time of the peak onset.</span></p>

  <ul class="c25 lst-kix_rhe48we21j2d-0 start">
    <li class="c16"><span class="c0 c8 c1">Flight</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c6 c12"><span class="c2 c0 c1">Jade flies very quickly and agilely through the sky. This is very
useful for scouting purposes or landing his other abilities like venomous bite on ranged
targets.</span></p>
  <ul class="c25 lst-kix_ruoammf9pqdl-0 start">
    <li class="c22 c31"><span class="c0 c8 c1">Claws &amp; Tail</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c6 c12"><span class="c0">Jade has long, sharp claws, and a long whip-like tail. Both are decent
options for aerial attacks, however his attack power is lower than most creatures given his
small size, so his ability to deal damage can be limited. His battle strategy usually is to go
</span><span class="c0">for venomous</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bite instead, however if he needs to he can swoop in for a quick swipe, and hope to dash back out
      before the opponent gets a strike back. Also as a reptile, scratches from him can also lead to nasty
infections in many species if the wound is not cleaned properly, which can eventually result in amputations or
sometimes even death if left to fester.</span></p>
