  <p>Lilith is the closest thing to a robot that exists in this world, the world that drives her mad as she tries to understand it. She wanders the world with no destination in mind, seeking justice for the weak. She has just as much trouble defining justice in her mind as she does applying it, but she does what she can despite being an outsider. Plus her lizard Jade is super cute.<p>
