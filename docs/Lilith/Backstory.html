  <p class="c17 c12"><span class="c2 c0 c1">Lilith was created by an experiment by a cult of religiously driven mad scientists. For this reason she deeply hates corrupt social hierarchies. In a painfully stereotypical fashion, she murdered the cult
      that had created her. She left her empty village and began wandering around aimlessly until she found Simul. </span></p>
  <p class="c12 c17"><span class="c2 c0 c1">She is comparable to a sort of biological machine hybrid. She&rsquo;s not a computer, however she shares similar character attributes (she incorporates large quantities of iron into her body, and she is
      highly intelligent/analytical, but she has more difficulty breaking into her creative mind, though ironically she can be quick to express her more primal emotions). She also has memory issues so she can often be forgetful.</span></p>
  <p class="c17 c12"><span class="c0">Her will and hunger are physically linked through her Destiny Apple which was created alongside her, and it drives her to seek justice in the world. She&rsquo;s sort of an outsider because of her iron skin and
      large size, and she has a strong bond with her lizard. She also can get a lot of hate from people who see her actions as drastic, or claim that she has no right to interfere as an outsider. She travels from city to city, trying to find
      happiness for herself and others. She is challenged by homelessness, and forgetting her purpose, sometimes leading her to act out of hunger for better or worse. </span></p>
