  <h2 class="c7" id="h.fr6642yop4hg"><span class="c14 c5">Items of Note</span></h2>
  <ul class="c25 lst-kix_6cjitlt9fs61-0 start">
    <li class="c16"><span class="c5">Item:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c39">Destiny </span><span class="c0 c1 c8">Apple</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c6 c12"><span class="c2 c0 c1">The Destiny Apple is a magical apple she can consume, and it provides her with a variety of nutrients (including certain hard to find minerals), whose quantity is based on how much she is at peace with
      herself. Eating it never consumes the item, however she can still starve if she betrays her sense of self. It is required to nourish her long-term, however she can eat other foods to fulfill other nutritional needs.</span></p>
  <ul class="c25 lst-kix_hqx8paee5ye5-0 start">
    <li class="c3"><span class="c5">Weapon:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c8 c1">Metal Skin, Nails, Hair &amp; Teeth</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c6 c12"><span class="c2 c0 c1">Not unlike how human&rsquo;s skin cells die and form into nail &amp; hair after they&rsquo;ve fulfilled their purpose, so does Lilith&rsquo;s iron skin ability. At the end of her fingers she has large
      pointed claws made of iron, which she grinds against rough rocks to sharpen and file. Her hair is also coated in iron, allowing her to use it as a whip if grown sufficiently long (she usually does this, and keeps it hidden inside her hood). Her
      teeth are also made of metal and can regrow, they are also mostly human shaped except the canines are especially large and sharp. Her skin is made of iron scales, which provides a strong bashing force.</span></p>
      <br/>
  <p class="c30"><span class="c5 c28 c1 c36">Miscellaneous Gear</span></p>
  <ol class="c25 lst-kix_gb58ikjti06x-0 start" start="1">
    <li class="c18"><span class="c2 c0 c1">Cloak (used to reduce attention to herself, and keep her body cool)</span></li>
    <li class="c18"><span class="c2 c0 c1">3x large water canteens (hydration is very important for her)</span></li>
    <li class="c18"><span class="c2 c0 c1">iron supplements (prunes, nuts, iron dust/shavings, etc)</span></li>
    <li class="c18"><span class="c2 c0 c1">sometimes a rock for shaving down the claws depending on the environment</span></li>
    <li class="c18"><span class="c2 c0 c1">any currency, though usually not a lot</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p class="c11"><span class="c0">Additionally Lilith is experienced in wilderness survival, so she can obtain food while traveling that way. This however can lead to her becoming nutritionally deficient, as wandering the wilderness for too long
      would cause the Destiny Apple to cease providing essential nutrients. She harvests valuable resources in nature (herbs, rare animal parts, rare rocks, etc) and sells them when she visits cities in order to make money.</span></p>
